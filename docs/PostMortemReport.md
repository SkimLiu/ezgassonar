Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best thing
* Spring Framework: during the project it was possible to learn to use and discover 
	the features offered by a framework such as Spring, unknown to all team members

# Worst things
* Activity assignment: difficult to estimate the required amount of work needed
	by activities resulting in a equal subdivision of work between team
	members
* Distributed team: difficult to communicate and organize the team, being located
	in different places

# Suggestions 
* Provide a clear and detailed explanation of all the things to do first for the next 
	deadline as soon as the previous one is finished in order to have more time to work on it.

* Define a new organization of the various deadline in order to finish the project at least a 
	week before the end of the lessons so as to avoid overlaps with the start of the exam session
